## Introduction

This document serves as the foundational reference for all R2D Service Technical Enhancement Proposals (STEPs), and contains the definitions of **BOLDED** terms.

## Requirement Levels

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

- **MUST / MUST NOT**: Indicates an absolute requirement.
- **SHOULD / SHOULD NOT**: Suggests a strong recommendation, with valid reasons for ignoring.
- **MAY / OPTIONAL**: Describes an action that is optional.

This document is maintained as a living resource to ensure clarity and consistency in the R2D development process.
This document SHOULD be updated in future PRs to include more refrence sections as required.
