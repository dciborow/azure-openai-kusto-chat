<!--=========================README TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS=============================
======================================================================================

- THIS README TEMPLATE LARGELY CONSISTS OF COMMENTED OUT TEXT. THIS UNRENDERED TEXT IS MEANT TO BE LEFT IN AS A GUIDE 
  THROUGHOUT THE REPOSITORY'S LIFE WHILE END USERS ONLY SEE THE RENDERED PAGE CONTENT. 
- Any italicized text rendered in the initial template is intended to be replaced IMMEDIATELY upon repository creation.

- This template is default but not mandatory. It was designed to compensate for typical gaps in Microsoft READMEs 
  that slow the pace of work. You may delete it if you have a fully populated README to replace it with.

- Most README sections below are commented out as they are not known early in a repository's life. Others are commented 
  out as they do not apply to every repository. If a section will be appropriate later but not known now, consider 
  leaving it in commented out and adding an issue as a reminder.
- There are additional optional README sections in the external instruction link below. These include; "citation",  
  "built with", "acknowledgments", "folder structure", etc.
- You can easily find the places to add content that will be rendered to the end user by searching 
within the file for "TODO".

## Access

<!-- 
INSTRUCTIONS:
- Please use this section to reduce the all-too-common friction & pain of getting read access and role-based permissions 
  to repos inside Microsoft. Please cover (a) Gaining a role with read, write, other permissions. (b) sharing a link to 
  this repository such that people who are not members of the organization can access it.
- If the repository is set to internalVisibility, you may also want to refer to the "Sharing a Link to this Repository" sub-section 
of the [README-Template instructions](https://aka.ms/StartRight/README-Template/Instructions#sharing-a-link-to-this-repository) so new GitHub EMU users know to get 1ES-Enterprise-Visibility MyAccess group access and therefore will have read rights to any repo set to internalVisibility.

_This repository prefers outside contributors start forks rather than branches. For pull requests more complicated 
than typos, it is often best to submit an issue first._

it useful to read these [tips & tricks](https://aka.ms/StartRight/README-Template/innerSource/2021_02_TipsAndTricksForCollaboration)
